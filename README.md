# share-msg

A fully peer to peer message sharing and link aggregation system.

This repository will provide the protocol description and the command line reference implementation.

## Things to consider
* Can we rely on pubkey/privkey for message signing?
* Hashcash to prevent spam?
* Some kind of open moderation to prevent undesirable content in curation?
* Servlets for content "message boards"?
* How to ensure content is shared network-wide?
* How to prevent attacks on the network? DoS?
* Peer discoveey?
* NAT punchthrough?
* Full nodes always ornalso support for lightweight nodes too?
